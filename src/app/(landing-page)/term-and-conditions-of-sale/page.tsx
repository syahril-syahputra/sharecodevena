                    <p>
                        These Terms and Conditions of Sale govern the agreement
                        between Venatronics LLC/Exepart Electronics, its
                        subsidiaries, or affiliates (referred to as
                        &quot;Seller&quot;) and Exepart&apos;s customers
                        (referred to as &quot;Customers&quot;) from the stock
                        owner manufacturers (&quot;Sources&quot;) for the sale
                        of products (&quot;Products&quot;). These terms and
                        conditions constitute the sole agreement regarding the
                        sale of products, superseding all previous proposals,
                        negotiations, conversations, discussions, agreements,
                        and representations, whether oral or written, including
                        any industry customs or past dealings between the
                        parties relating to the sale of products.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The availability and pricing displayed on the website
                        are an invitation for the Customer to submit an offer.
                        Responses to quotes and other inquiries for pricing and
                        availability do not constitute an offer from Seller.
                        Acceptance of an offer will be in writing, either
                        through an Order Confirmation email or Electronic Data
                        Interchange (EDI) acknowledgement. Acceptance may also
                        occur through the execution of the Customer&apos;s order
                        by Seller. It is important to note that when a customer
                        places an order through Seller&rsquo;s website, the
                        preliminary written reply on the website does not
                        indicate acceptance of the order.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unless otherwise specified on the Seller&apos;s invoice
                        or acknowledgment, payment terms are TT advance for
                        Customers and net 30 for Sources to ensure the safety of
                        both Sources and Customers. Prices are EXW Seller&apos;s
                        facility (INCOTERMS 2010) for Customers and do not
                        include taxes, freight, handling, duty, or similar
                        charges, which are the sole responsibility of the
                        Customer. Sources will be responsible for delivering
                        their products to the designated courier appointed by
                        Seller for shipment to the nearest Seller&apos;s
                        affiliate. Prices are contingent upon timely payment by
                        the Customer, and any overdue balance will accrue
                        interest at a monthly rate of one and a half percent.
                        Freight charges may be estimated based on standard
                        carrier tariffs and may not reflect actual
                        transportation costs. Seller reserves the right to
                        modify terms prior to shipment, request payment in
                        advance, or delay/cancel any shipment or order if the
                        Customer&apos;s creditworthiness is in question or if
                        the Customer fails to fulfill obligations on time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If no prior carrier selection is in place for shipping,
                        the Seller may choose a carrier. The Seller&apos;s
                        responsibility for loss or damage ceases, and title
                        passes, upon delivery of the products to the carrier,
                        Customer, or Customer&apos;s agent (including test
                        houses or value-added service providers), whichever
                        occurs first. If the Seller holds products at the
                        Customer&apos;s request for rescheduled delivery or
                        further instructions, the Customer will be responsible
                        for storage charges.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Seller agrees to transfer any transferable warranties
                        received from the Source of the Products to the
                        Customer. Seller provides no other warranties, express
                        or implied, regarding the Products. Specifically, Seller
                        provides no warranty regarding the merchantability of
                        the Products or their suitability or fitness for any
                        particular purpose or use, or with respect to
                        infringement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Seller&apos;s liability arising from the sale of
                        products to the Customer is expressly limited to either
                        (1) refunding the purchase price paid by the Customer
                        for such Products (without interest), or (2) repairing
                        and/or replacing such Products, at Seller&apos;s
                        discretion. These remedies are exclusive and exclude all
                        others. The Customer must notify Seller of any defective
                        product within 90 days from the date of shipment. This
                        warranty excludes all other warranties, whether oral,
                        written, expressed, implied, or statutory. Implied
                        warranties of fitness for a particular purpose and
                        merchantability are specifically excluded and do not
                        apply. The Customer&apos;s obligations and Seller&apos;s
                        remedies regarding defective or nonconforming products
                        are solely as stated in these terms and conditions.
                        Furthermore, no warranty will apply if the Product has
                        been subject to misuse, static discharge, neglect,
                        accident, modification, soldering, or alteration in any
                        way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Customer&apos;s exclusive remedy under these
                        warranties is limited to refund, repair, or replacement
                        as determined by the Seller. The Seller assumes no
                        responsibility or liability for manufacturer&apos;s
                        product specifications or the performance of any design
                        or specification provided by the Customer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Seller retains a purchase money security interest in
                        all products sold until the purchase price and any other
                        charges are fully paid. In the event of the
                        Customer&apos;s breach of these terms and conditions,
                        the Seller has rights and remedies as a secured party
                        under applicable law. The Customer is responsible for
                        all costs incurred by the Seller in collecting
                        outstanding sums, including collection agency fees and
                        reasonable attorney&apos;s fees. The Seller has the
                        right to offset any amount owed by the Seller or its
                        subsidiaries to the Customer against any amount owed by
                        the Customer to the Seller or its subsidiaries. All
                        transactions are governed by the laws of the State of
                        California, and the parties waive the right to a trial
                        by jury.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Products are considered accepted by the Customer unless
                        written notice of shortages, damage, or defects is
                        provided to the Seller within 10 days of delivery. No
                        returns are permitted without a Return Authorization
                        Form issued by the Seller. If the Customer refuses to
                        accept or return products without authorization, the
                        Seller will hold the products for 20 days before
                        considering them abandoned and disposing of them without
                        crediting the Customer&apos;s account.
                    </p>

                    <p>Sales Tax:</p>

                    <p>
                        For US shipments, Seller will collect Federal, State,
                        and/or Local sale, use, excise, and other taxes as
                        required by law. These taxes are in addition to the
                        purchase price and must be remitted by the Customer,
                        unless the Customer is tax exempt and has provided a
                        valid signed tax exemption certificate to Seller.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For international shipments, all applicable VAT, PST,
                        HST, and/or GST charges, along with brokerage fees, are
                        the responsibility of the Customer and are due at the
                        time of delivery.
                    </p>

                    <p>Force Majeure:</p>

                    <p>
                        Seller shall not be held liable for delays in delivery
                        or failure to perform its obligations due to causes
                        beyond its reasonable control, including product
                        allocations, material shortages, labor disputes,
                        transportation delays, unforeseen circumstances, acts of
                        God, acts or omissions of other parties, acts or
                        omissions of civil or military authorities, government
                        priorities, fires, strikes, floods, severe weather
                        conditions, computer interruptions, terrorism,
                        epidemics, quarantine restrictions, riots, or war.
                        Seller&apos;s time for delivery or performance will be
                        extended by the period of such delay, or Seller may, at
                        its option, cancel any order or remaining part thereof
                        without liability by providing notice to the Customer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This document supersedes any purchase order or customer
                        document and is considered an offer. By accepting
                        products or services, making payments, or placing orders
                        after receiving these terms and conditions, the Customer
                        is deemed to have agreed to these terms and conditions,
                        regardless of any conflicting terms in prior or
                        subsequent communications. The Seller&apos;s failure to
                        object to any document or act by the Customer does not
                        waive these terms and conditions. Any changes or
                        additions to these terms and conditions must be agreed
                        upon in writing by an authorized officer of the Seller.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the Customer&apos;s order is placed under a contract
                        with the United States Government, the Seller agrees to
                        comply only with the contract provisions and regulations
                        communicated in writing by the Customer. United States
                        Government Cost Accounting Standards do not apply. The
                        Seller reserves all rights to technical data and
                        software owned or licensed by the Seller or the
                        manufacturer. Unless specifically agreed in writing by
                        the Seller, the products are not intended for use in
                        life support systems, human implantation, nuclear
                        facilities or systems, or any application where product
                        failure could result in loss of life or catastrophic
                        property damage. The Customer will indemnify and hold
                        the Seller harmless from any loss, cost, or damage
                        resulting from the Customer&apos;s breach of this
                        provision.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Products may be subject to export or resale restrictions
                        and regulations, and the Customer acknowledges the
                        obligation to comply with such restrictions. Statements
                        regarding product origin, Export Control Classification
                        Number, or compliance with applicable laws are based on
                        information provided to the Seller by its suppliers, and
                        the Seller does not guarantee accuracy. The Seller,
                        Source, and Customer certify compliance with all
                        applicable laws, including labor laws and anti-bribery
                        regulations, in the jurisdictions where they operate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Except for the exclusive warranty remedy described
                        above, neither the Seller nor its Sources shall be
                        liable to the Customer or any other person for any
                        claim, loss, damage, or expense arising directly or
                        indirectly from product inadequacy, deficiency, defect,
                        use, performance, or the Seller&apos;s failure or delay
                        in performance. This includes consequential, exemplary,
                        or punitive damages, even if the Seller was informed of
                        the possibility of such damages. The Seller&apos;s
                        liability, regardless of basis, is limited to the price
                        paid for the product or service that gave rise to the
                        claim.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Value-added services may void the Source&apos;s warranty
                        and make products non-returnable. Orders incorporating
                        such services are non-cancelable, and the products are
                        non-returnable. Third-party value-added service
                        providers are considered agents of the Customer. The
                        Seller provides technical advice as an accommodation to
                        the Customer and assumes no liability for the content or
                        use of such advice.

                        Software or intellectual property included in or related
                        to the products is supplied by the manufacturer or
                        licensor, and the Seller makes no representation or
                        warranty regarding such software or intellectual
                        property. The Customer agrees to comply with all
                        requirements and rights related to proprietary and
                        similar rights in the intellectual property. The
                        Customer will indemnify the Seller against any
                        liability, cost, or expense resulting from a breach of
                        these requirements or from the Customer&apos;s use or
                        sale of the products.
